In the case of this property, it reflects the ultimate aspiration of Southern California Living. Every day upon arriving home, you are gazing straight at the blue Pacific at the end of Loring Street. It’s so close you can smell the salt and sleepwalk to the surf. Last changing hands 50 years ago, here is your chance to create the ultimate coastal dream. The property features two homes ready for renaissance. The front home offers a 1-car garage and additionally, off the alley access, there is a 2-car garage and another 1-car garage. The property is essentially original and will require full restoration, but the potential is unlimited.The location is a premium offering in North Pacific Beach, just an evening walk from Bird Rock. The front home is extraordinarily spacious with two fireplaces. Over the years it has been expanded with a huge family room in the back and features the entire 2nd floor as a primary suite. The floorplan is actually very open and lends itself to a modern re-interpretation once you clear out the existing dated interior.

"San Diego",,,"CA","2921 Imperial Ave",,"92102","5","5","37%","USD","2023-03-21","2","Conventional financing or Cash only. Zoned as Commercial (mixed with residential-use opportunity!). Fantastic location for fixer opportunity or for primary residence. PLEASE NOTE: Not your traditional home layout. Owner has removed the living and family rooms and converted the entire homes living space into 5 private bedrooms with their own full bath (NO PERMITS). Each room has its own entrance from the outside of the home. Only 1 kitchen that they all share. Additionally, the owner has added 5 RV campers (on wheels) in the backyard that he also rents on Airbnb. These can be moved out of the backyard through the back alley exit.My recommendation would be to tear down some of the interior walls in order to restore it back to its original and traditional style 2 bedroom home with a living and family room. Tenants in the main house (the only long term tenants) have been given a 60 day notice and will remain in the home through May 3rd 2023. (cash for keys may be a possibility). All backyard Airbnb campers are rented out on a maximum 1-3 day term at $32.00 per day.","141","FOR_SALE","SINGLE_FAMILY","32.706085","realtoralexgarcia@gmail.com","Alexander C Garcia","619-520-6402","https://www.zillow.com/profile/AlexanderGarcia/","1006","-117.131516","2151","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/569739da7002b6c77dfd73e052a780e1-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8c4c5f9844e6b2377856272abf292f73-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/aee7598002cafac94ffa93c5a798898f-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/eccaa50be3e31d50ad973bf1fa362fdb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7150ab60129dc6498d2004d82ab33ce2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/d41686d15e5fe036249fcccbd786bfba-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c4c933a39eebd4319ab4411d9aece9e5-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6cf7df0c35e8ee9f4b2775fb2d295958-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/6b5f809aad8b9d197ea20690e2ea54d4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/847b75e89dedebcaeacf466e56d6546e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3f56c14b7e413242590cf95c94d075d4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2c8c211bf320804c2886a2130fbb608e-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c7ba9e4a225d7100073d31cfdf8d0d49-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7b629be6722e94f6f4f0629cb42d537c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c13f24b3fa02aed50795d6f07e20ae4a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/95184426f3c93fed5f6234653c36bf2b-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2f1452c8e42fb4f1bea298935d621055-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0495eb6b5895f0056bd78e0848e6b782-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/78fcd4417e27675fabb11cce394d5fb8-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4c7fc9d0ce49467bddbe241f38ebc8c0-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/5180c82381a1a36aaaade91c2b860602-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/63bfd7c05bdc1b4dd9d9e5d1553984a3-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9684f2b5dcbe4a49f38f954b77fbd261-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/22ba5c67a8886d6199a770ae431d5e77-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"550000","3264","2 days","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/2921-Imperial-Ave-San-Diego-CA-92102/17084702_zpid/","1908","561020","17084702"

And speaking of bonus, there is a huge bonus room that can be used as a game room, home school room,or flex work space….just use your imagination! The kitchen has been transformed with a new stainless deep sink, a new island, backsplash and quartz counter tops, and the recessed lighting and brand new stainless appliances create a modern and sleek look. The waterproof wood laminate flooring and wide baseboards that were recently installed throughout the entire house adds durability and style, and it anchors the large living room with its classic original brick fireplace. The main bedroom is bathed in light while the remodeled main bathroom is stunning with dual sinks, new vanity and brand new shower. All walls have been freshly painted, and when you head upstairs, you will love the "" ship lap look"" (say that 10 times fast!) of the walls in the two bedrooms. There is a small alcove for an office and don’t forget to look for a plethora of storage behind closets and doors. The home also features a rare detached garage which would make for a perfect ADU, providing extra space for guests, family member, or rental income. Located just minutes from remarkable schools, shopping and delectable restaurants makes it an ideal location for those who love the convenience of nearby amenities. And the icing on the cake?

"San Diego",,,"CA","2961 1st Ave",,"92103","5","4","74%","USD","2023-03-02","20","Architectural beauty has the capacity to transcend time, space, form and function. On rare occasions, a masterpiece presents itself that surpasses all barriers so that it no longer can be singularly described. This Bankers Hill residence encapsulates original Georgian historic opulence, coalescing seamlessly into a masterstroke of contemporary elegant living. Our world has evolved and so has the way we live our lives. Casual elegance is not just a passing trend, it has become an integral way of life and entertainment. This residence has evolved into a modern storybook, yet never leaving behind the grace and pedigree of its origins. It is a Mills Act recipient, which carries a tremendous advantage of property tax reduction for historic homes, yet you never have to give up the technology, efficiency or glamour of a modern SoCal lifestyle.The residence is an estate of the highest quality. The original home was restored and reimagined through every room, wall and facet of the structure. The floorplan was reconstructed to provide a luxurious experience and over 1,100sf of living space was added. The spectacular formal living, dining and family rooms currently serve as the pulse of a modern, carefree living experience. The heart and soul of the home is the stunning kitchen, wet and dry butler pantries, and breakfast enclave which now serves as the formal dining room. Double the size of the original kitchen, the space is an expression of the intelligence of design, amid an abundance of beauty. The centerpiece is a Viking Limited Edition Series range. With a production run of only 110 units, its bold artistry still puts form and function front and center. The rest of the kitchen is awash in Carrara marble counters, a massive island, an abundance of cabinetry and storage, and a full suite of chef inspired appliances.  The estate features a quality primary suite, which views west to the harbor. The primary bath and wardrobe are as elegant as they are functional. You could get lost in the massive Carrara Tile Grotto shower, or soak all evening in the step up adjoining tub. The remaining bedrooms all have en-suite baths and offer the same quality experience. A beautiful breezeway above the backyard connects the main residence to a guest suite with its own en-suite bath. Perhaps the newest focal point of the home is the reimagined backyard that was created with a built-in BBQ, outdoor Sauna and Spa, custom lighting and music, relaxing lounge area and another spectacular outdoor shower. You may never leave home again. But if you do decide to leave, this home has been retrofitted and expanded with an equally amazing garage system.

Two of the other bathrooms are conveniently located throughout the home. In addition to the front door there is another door close to the kitchen and one of the two master suites. If the buyer of this home wanted to they could make this a private entrance for extra privacy.

"La Jolla",,,"CA","5552 Via Callado",,"92037","6","4","43%","USD","2023-02-11","39","Tucked away at the end of a tranquil cul-de-sac, this beautiful modern home is the custom creation of Pelican Development LLC and award-winning EOS Architecture Inc. Completed in 2016, this 14,000SqFt lot uniquely emphasizes the coveted indoor-outdoor living experience and is designed to serve as a serene private haven to relax with family or entertain guests all while enjoying the impressive coastal views. A long driveway leads up to the two-story residence revealing its striking exterior and a three-car garage with cedar doors complimenting the contemporary-style of the home. Upon entering, the foyer makes a statement from all angles, showcasing a honed marble slab floor, hardwood floors and custom cypress wood adorning the ceiling to match the detail in the upper-level dining area. The property features high-end interior and exterior finishes and hardware, such as Lutron lighting, Marantz sound, and a water filtration system throughout.  On the first floor, concealed behind the north side entryway wall, are two ensuite bedrooms, one of which offers a passageway to a grassy outdoor area — one of the two private side yards that incorporate a thoughtful landscape design.  Also on the main level is a guest bath, large laundry room with convenient garage entry, the luxury of a Savaria Eclipse elevator offering easy accessibility to the second floor, and a climate-controlled wine room. The downstairs is also a place to retreat or entertain with its spacious media room outfitted with sleek multi-slide pocket doors that connect the in-home entertainment hub and wet bar to the south-facing covered patio complete with a fireplace, secluded pool and jacuzzi, built-in BBQ, and outdoor stairs leading to the upper-level to easily come and go while retrieving items from the kitchen. Take the elevator or use the indoor/outdoor stairs to access the second floor, be greeted with its high ceilings and abundance of natural light from the thoughtfully positioned skylights, windows, and stacking glass walls. Endless views of the coastline, Mission Bay, downtown San Diego, and the Coronado Bridge are visible from the great room, and open-air terrace resulting in breathtaking white water ocean views and incredible sunsets.   The open-concept floor plan features an expansive living area that combines the dining room, living room, and gourmet kitchen. The dining area displays elegance with a custom mahogany built-in side cabinetry and quartzite countertops, the living room encourages a cozy atmosphere with its limestone accents and fireplace, and the kitchen features the same materials used in the dining room visually tying the spaces together. The sizable gourmet kitchen with its large center island bar features high-quality stainless steel appliances seamlessly incorporated into the modern design, including a Sub-Zero full-size overlay refrigerator and beverage fridge, a six-burner Wolf gas range with a Zephyr range hood, dual Bosch dishwashers, dual Wolf convection wall ovens, and a Wolf built-in microwave drawer. Located on the upper level, a luxurious master suite retreat complete with a balcony designed as a dynamic sanctuary space to comfortably ease into the morning with stunning ocean views and peacefully unwind at night while enjoying the intimate double-sided fireplace. The room also features an ample walk-in closet and the bonus of a connecting private office, and a spa-like master bathroom with a fireside soaking tub, a large walk-in shower, and coastal views.

Value range from $3,495,000 - $3,695,000.The first all-glass Super Prime residential tower in San Diego offers an unprecedented waterfront lifestyle with sky-high amenities and picture-postcard views. Directly overlooking the waterfront, the 41-story tower contains an exclusive offering of homes designed by Hirsch Bedner Associates. Renowned New York-based architectural firm Kohn Pedersen Fox (KPF) created a landmark that reimagined the San Diego skyline. The custom-engineered glass walls dynamically reflect the hues of the sky and the Pacific Ocean. Pacific Gate has evolved the San Diego skyline and represents the future of the city. The building is comprised of two-nested curved glass towers that rise as a single column from a three-story ground floor retail podium on the north and west sides of the tower. Because of the building’s curves and exterior glass, Pacific Gate offers a striking viewing experience from every vantage point. Residents arrive home to a beautifully landscaped motor court with a private luxury car fleet, which leads to a double-height lobby with a 24-hour concierge and porter services. Two levels of amenities boast a residents lounge ideal for events and everyday use, the fitness center contains an extensive range of state-of-the-art equipment. Adjacent to the fitness center is the steam and sauna retreats that open up to the fourth-floor pool terrace fitted with poolside cabanas and glass surround.","62","FOR_SALE","CONDO","32.7151","info@finepropertiessd.com","Cristi

Built in 1887, the Sherman Doig historically designated, Mills Acted home, is in amazing condition. Zoning allows for additional uses such as doctor, dentist, psychologist and office.Buyer to confirm permitted uses before close of escrow. With new purchase price, property taxes will be only approximately $5,000-$6,000 per year [Buyer to verify before purchasing] due to the Mills Act. Buyers could live on the top two floors which is a 2000 square foot apartment and rent out the lower floors to pay their mortgage. Lower two floors are zoned commercial. Top two floors are zoned residential. There are too many options to mention. You have to tour this magnificent property to appreciate its versatility. Possibility for professional offices on the lower two floors. Or Airbnb on the top two floors or long term rental. This 15 room Victorian Lady is conveniently located just across the freeway from Downtown. It's walking distance to Little Italy, Balboa Park, San Diego Zoo, Trolley Stops, Gaslamp, Petco Park, Waterfront Park, and San Diego Bay.The possibilities for this completely, unique property are endless. It's commercially zoned for professional offices or you may use it as Bed and Breakfast or just do long term rentals on all five areas that could be made separate from each other. My favorite aspect of this property is that even though it's historic, there is no deferred maintenance.

My favorite aspect of this property is that even though it's historic, there is no deferred maintenance. The heating and air conditioning systems are four years old. In fact it had the Airport Authority sound proofing a couple of years ago. The roof is only 7 years old. The entire house was completely painted recently and the driveway, where you can park 6 cars tandem was redone as well.","54","FOR_SALE","SINGLE_FAMILY","32.725334","RealEstate@AnthonyNapoli.com","Anthony Napoli","619-750-3558","https://www.zillow.com/profile/AnthonyNapoliRealtor/","4058","-117.16458","1818","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/b7453865166414dd61919a9d6c2bb56a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f37f261489e16e943ab3ebc8750c9971-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f6aaca92dc44bde3b5265296195672b0-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/82dd430f3efd39ad467ba50034f08d16-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9f3c381650259d0996cb4c3bfe6c5c1c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0035f2bcf8494a8ee48f3da06938772a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c7648832ee8b2294ff6b27e9ab84b233-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/37ad706990c41d219bfb910bb6690176-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/9318c61449f82708ab1f09a67acc1c88-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ae61f6b4bfb51bce5dc45e83f4af904d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3bf12d790ed2665432eb2b7a031faae5-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/44a70e1242859a2934ab54b0ce6097bf-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/dc099785447f8f2725c9dfa9760f8f58-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/00d253b97c7ed1bbfef7b1ab6accd677-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/3cb6316f5aeb26f554b77f02bef33e70-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/dbcf3995216f9ecdd7d97311adf528f5-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/98529a213ba31e838148bf65333b6fac-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c96724ef83ece9ea9f37a6641d1ef9e2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/913e9cb03ae5a4f33ab0750e116009bb-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/dcc066a192c6ca56b3409b7f578724c4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/120e778565ec1af92c5309c00b41b09d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/e208a34650f42e624da30dbca7841561-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/1713799094636dfb58d43f0bd84a13ea-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/2ad5e014ef9c11b55586c2ad3e2bfbd7-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2195000","10292","272 days","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/136-W-Fir-St-San-Diego-CA-92101/295359727_zpid/","1887","2057812","295359727"

Welcome to The Manhattan, THE Penthouse masterpiece channeling the essence of a coveted urban existence. Soaring walls of glass in the main living spaces embrace the sky and inclusively capture the idyllic surrounding beauty of Bankers Hill. Almost 4000sf of urban interior perfection transitions seamlessly into what is perhaps the grandest outdoor living offering of 3 massive terraces in San Diego highrise living. Formal and informal entertainment and gathering spaces, dual Primary Suites that have no peer, and views stretching 270 degrees over some of San Diego’s most pristine vistas. The residence has been evaluated for installation of an after-market glass elevator (see artist renderings in photos).Introducing the new look of luxury in San Diego’s prized Bankers Hill neighborhood. This curated collection of residences at 41 West exemplifies the passionate life that is Southern California, with a nod to the easy living feel that is uniquely San Diego. Careful consideration was given to create a product grand in scale, yet smartly crafted for today’s active lifestyle. Each facet of the building has been carefully vetted to provide its residents an ideal urban lifestyle.  The developer’s vision and center of inspiration was all about maximizing the indoor to outdoor transitional living experience. Welcome to the NanaWalls. These State-of-the-Art telescoping walls of glass, featured in every residence, provide a seamless experience with minimal frames, sleek clean lines and providing expansive unobstructed views whether opened or closed. Furthermore, each residence is a portrait of sublime fixtures and finishes that accentuate the harmonious palette of space and light. Whether you like Miele or Italian Armony Cucine in your kitchen, to Kohler and Toto in the baths, the list of features will seem endless.  Feature 10’ ceilings in the living and dining areas to emphasize the drama! The VRF zoning systems provide the best product in individual air circulation. Expansive terraces has been fitted with a direct gas hookup so that you can set up your own personal outdoor BBQ chef station. Staying true to Green and sustainability, individual EV charging stations can be installed at your unit’s assigned parking!  There is a continuity in this building that flows from the grand two-story lobby entrance, all the way to the oversized Mitsubishi elevators. Speaking of Grand Lobby, the original plans actually had a full residence that was removed from the final design to create this grand entrance. Every person who enters 41 West now encounters a stunning experience each and every time they return home or to visit.  41 West offers the latest in discerning amenities and security. It begins with 24-hour lobby attendant and secure underground parking, FOB controlled doors, elevators and common areas, plus 24/7 video monitoring provides that extra level of security. There is a fireside lounge for arriving and departing guests or just stop by for a friendly chat. Conveniently located on the first level is a resident lounge that features a Full Swing golf simulator. Additionally, there is a large screen TV as well as a wet bar. It’s the perfect community gathering place. Adjacent to the lounge is a private fitness center that welcomes your personal training sessions (with appointments) and offers towel and water service. Arguably the cherry on top is the pet wash and grooming center with easy access to an alternate exterior building exit. Add to this the best bicycle and storage room you have seen in Metro San Diego and you will be hooked!  As you can see, the community amenities are plenty, but the biggest one is being on the doorstep of San Diego’s Crown Jewel playground - Balboa Park! Whether it’s walking, picnics, bicycling, theater, museums or nature walks, residents will have the year-round enjoyment of one of the largest and most diverse city parks in the entire United States. 41 West is not just an address but truly the coveted lifestyle that defines luxury living in San Diego.","61","FOR_SALE","CONDO","32.732746","gina@kengina.com","Gina L

The unit is located on the second level, which is the top floor of the complex. Only seven units are in the complex, and Unit #7 is an end unit at the rear of the building, where it is away from the street and more quiet. The unit has an open floor plan for the kitchen and living room. From the balcony, there is a pleasant view looking to the East of the neighborhood, which extends for several blocks. There is also room for chairs and plants on the balcony. The assigned parking space is the one closest to the rear gate, which provides easy access to the property. There is also a front gate near the street, which is the entrance for showing. There is excellent access to freeways -- it is in-between the 15 and 805 freeways and only about one-half mile from each freeway, and one short block south of El Cajon Boulevard. A lot of parking is available on the street. Very good public transportation is nearby on El Cajon Boulevard. Pets are allowed by the HOA, both dogs and cats. The grounds are well maintained, with attractive landscaping.

"Coronado",,,"CA","1127 F Ave",,"92118","9","5","51%","USD","2023-02-13","37","MILLS ACT! MILLS ACT! MILLS ACT!! A bookmark in Coronado's storied history, this stunning Spanish eclectic residence sits on a palm-lined promenade just 100 feet from the shore. One of the largest lots in Coronado, the historical landmark encompasses a 14,142-square foot main house, sprawling guest house, and private garden sanctuary with tranquil fountains and estancia. Originally built for business magnate W.A. Gunn, the five- bedroom (option for six), eight-bathroom abode features vintage Hollywood glamour adorned with state-of-the-art amenities for optimal luxury living space, replete with castle-like characteristics. Conceived by the illustrious Richard Requa in 1925, the previous owner preserved priceless historical heritage to a tee. Dominated by an impressive turret that acts as an entrance hall, the home's exotic allure is undeniable, revealing a stunning foyer with spiral staircase and striking, hand-hewn beams Echoing with the kind of extravagance that underscored the 1920s, ""Coronado Castle"" perfectly captures the era's zeitgeist, rife with opulent tile flooring, ornate ironwork, and stained-glass touches. An immaculately hand painted coffered ceiling dominates the formal dining room, punctuating the voluminous expanse that bleeds outward to the pool deck via a trio of custom steel glass doors. Grounded in reclaimed 18th century European terracotta tile, Spanish embellishments abound. A capacious kitchen is poised for entertaining, appointed with an 80-inch La Cornue range and rotisserie, double Subzero fridge, Miele steam oven and coffee station, plus wet bar. Illuminated by custom light fixtures, the kitchen is anchored by an immense marble island. Preserving period details while meticulously updating the home to modern-day standards, historically accurate embellishments have been implemented throughout. Reimagined with an opulent mix of rare finishes and Moorish tiling sourced from around the world, new renovations masterfully mirror Requa's original concept and inspirations. Evoking a 5-star feel with firepit lounge, wet bar, and dining area, the turret's third-floor roof deck affords panoramic ocean views. The lavish basement is just as impressive. Designed with a grand staircase and soaring ceilings, the voluminous expanse boasts a golf simulator, media room with bar, trophy room, 25-seat movie theater with projector, 1,300+ SqFt world class gym, and full spa with dry sauna, massage table, and ice bath. Inducing an air of timeless luxury, a stunning pool deck sets the stage for summertime soirees, complete with 250-year-old stonework, Moorish ironwork, full outdoor kitchen, and dining estancia. The lush oasis includes 100-year-old rustic olive trees, three fountains, a putting green, secret garden, and dog run. Perfect for out-of-town guests, a detached guest house is equally sumptuous, appointed with a full bathroom and kitchen.

The open floor plan is built for entertaining with 20-foot sliding doors, skylights, and a fresh breeze. The space sits between a brick courtyard and an expansive 2,000-square-foot deck. Solid Cherry cabinetry, stone countertops, and high-end appliances accent the light-filled kitchen with cathedral ceilings. Tudor arched doors/windows/hallways, numerous skylights, crystal doorknobs, and original hardwood floors enhance the architectural charm. Mature fruit trees scatter the landscape along with low-irrigation landscaping. The primary bedroom engulfs the second floor of the original Tudor home. There are dual sinks, dual walk-in closets, an oversized travertine tile shower, and views to the ocean. An attached 2-car garage supports EV charging with a 220V plug-in. There are 30 owned solar panels, two water heaters, two laundry rooms, and two kitchens.

The crunch of leaves underfoot. The brick red color is perfectly highlighted by the dappled afternoon sun, streaming through the branches of the live oak trees that have been there longer than any person has. You reach for the handle of the enclosed patio door & are welcomed by that familiar creak as it opens. Slip off your boots at the front door, walk inside & take a minute to let it sink in. This is a home with a patina, a history, a knowing. It isn’t a place to rush. Instead, it’s where you stop, slow down, & just- breathe. Inside you are happy to see that the house isn’t too big. This isn’t a ...home where everyone goes to separate rooms and corners, closes the door & puts their headphones on ...This is a place where time together isn’t forced, exactly, but encouraged. Whether it’s gathering around the corner fireplace wrapped in artisanal tile in rich neutral colors, or sitting amongst the leaves on the tree-top level balcony sipping lemonade as if in your very own tree house, all grown up. The yard outside is big enough to tuck a vegetable garden between the already mature apple, plum & peach trees in the spring & summer months, & right by the road is the perfect spot for a giant, lopsided snowman- built by little hands cold from the snow until that first batch of hot chocolate is brought out. This is a spot for togetherness, for adventures outside & relaxation within. We all need to step back from the chaotic busyness & reconnect once in a while; to the earth, to each other, to ourselves. This is the place to do that.This is Home.","74","FOR_SALE","SINGLE_FAMILY","33.06419","graham.levine@compass.com","Graham A Levine","760-421-1733",,"880","-116.57697","2441","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8727c3e11a017dc66405a24a5fdb2963-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/8b9e3d027b6e01f48776b5c7b67848b5-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/0c15da7c21ef73f9b1f0f907f68348ce-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/7fe0eb7a675716d3a2e46d0cf120ccf6-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/090a53964b0f1d5b2eb371327465086a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/46ebef3630f858f32fabace07b4ff6d2-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/84c1efea4e00968267ca853ce0acae63-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/c55d7a6816f52d9a0e0c3fc5865e169c-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/65f406e9076274304cd8f42849a8987a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/78c6d1372c31eba36625605499286c86-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/69b9eabd77558e0732fb73fb1c00eee4-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4055d2354c0cec7c9538a80f44224889-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/850829a2874da4a27d4fdc5db8949387-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/19e176ebd45bd44364b5f36db6b63525-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/4312360bcfefed0407271b92de5d0556-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/989f722c112a13c2ebd2d10f2b39932a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/ac2bf593fd108d6510961f38a9cc265d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/704a9ca5fee221439f706be098c802fc-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/044c749344b581fd4d7f41e0786b6c4d-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/34fd753c5d78cbe58e2441ecb8888f4a-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/f30c39d52d170d31729b70e97d31ce79-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/cfb1f8e2678acb55eba68c05faedf804-p_d.jpg","https://photos.zillowstatic.com/fp/335420ee794062b8fb85f9b093400c7f-p_d.jpg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"425000","2149","23 days","https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/808-Pine-Cone-Dr-Julian-CA-92036/16758292_zpid/","1977","434379","16758292"

Carmel Valley is a suburban planned community in the north-western corner of San Diego, California, United States. The community is composed of commercial offices, residential units, hotels, retail stores and restaurants. Carmel Valley is one of the newer neighborhoods of the City of San Diego, California. The community was formed by the City of San Diego on February 1, 1975. The construction began in 1983.

Carmel Valley is a suburban planned community in the north-western corner of San Diego, California, United States. The community is composed of commercial offices, residential units, hotels, retail stores and restaurants. Carmel Valley is one of the newer neighborhoods of the City of San Diego, California. The community was formed by the City of San Diego on February 1, 1975. The construction began in 1983. The name Carmel Valley comes from the Carmelite Sisters of Mercy, who established a dairy farm and monastery in the area c. 1905. Although the area was known locally as Carmel Valley, in 1974 the area was given the institutional name North City West in the master plan. The name Carmel Valley was readopted in the early 1990s Carmel Valley is bordered to the north by the North City Future Urbanizing Area and Pacific Highlands Ranch; to the south by Los Peñasquitos Canyon Preserve and Torrey Hills. Carmel Valley is bordered to the north by the North City Future Urbanizing Area (NCFUA) and Pacific Highlands Ranch; to the south by Los Peñasquitos Canyon Preserve and Torrey Hills; to the east by Pacific Highlands Ranch and Del Mar Mesa; and to the west by Interstate 5 and Torrey Pines. Nearby is the Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve, where one of two stands of the endangered Torrey Pine is found to occur. The area overlooks the ocean and is located in the hills. While many people in the area are now referring to the entire 92130 zip code as Carmel Valley, the actual boundaries of the community remain unchanged from the original community plan. Carmel Valley has an overlay of various school districts. For the elementary schools, the northern section is part of the Solana Beach School District (K-6). The southern section is managed by the Del Mar Union School District (K-6). Overlaying the entire community, the San Dieguito Union High School District manages the middle schools and high schools. Some Carmel Valley residents attend schools in the bordering communities of Pacific Highlands Ranch, Torrey Hills, and Torrey Pines. Carmel Valley schools are known for outstanding education and rigorous academics.

"San Pedro",,,"CA","721 W 32nd St",,"90731","2","3","98%","USD","2023-03-16","6","How would you feel waking up to a beautiful sunrise like this every morning? What about watching the active LA Harbor as the ships sail through Angels Gate? The snow-capped mountains or maybe the beautiful twinkling lights after the sun goes down? Well, this charming 1950s Bungalow perched high up on a hill offers you that opportunity. Imagine enjoying panoramic harbor, mountain, city light & ocean views from the wrap-around deck, kitchen living area & your interior living spaces while also enjoying the privacy that comes with living way above street level. As you make your way from the sidewalk, up the stairway and towards the gated front yard area the view will open up further and further with each step you take. Once you reach the front yard, the first thing you'll notice is the composite deck that wraps around the front of the home and offers multiple areas to sit and take in the breathtaking vistas. Upon entering the home you'll be captivated by the charm of the 1950s architecture that has been blended with modern upgrades to offer some of the old & some of the new. The bright sunlit interior is freshly painted and the original oak hardwood floors have been refinished in a ""bleached ebony"" stain to create a more contemporary feeling. The sunlit living room and dining area are positioned at the front of the house to take advantage of the views and lead you to the bright kitchen that features white cabinetry, quartz counters, built-in appliances and a breakfast area. Laundry equipment was moved from the service porch to the basement so the service porch now make a great walk-in pantry. The main hall leads you to the three bedrooms, an upgraded full bath and a charming half bath. New doors, hardware and light fixtures finish off the interior. What about the systems? Well it has central heating, upgraded electrical system and copper plumbing (where visible, buyer to verify). Basement area is where you'll find the laundry area and plenty of storage. There's a large rear yard with concrete patio and a 2 car detached garage on the alley with additional driveway parking for another 2-3 cars. The lot is zoned LARD2 which should allow for an additional unit and an ADU if you choose to maximize the lot's potential (buyer to verify). In addition to the views you'll enjoy the fresh air and cool ocean breezes that come with living in this area of San Pedro. If you're looking for a million $ view without the heavy price tag, this home is for you.
